# Firebase Extensions Example

A simple Flutter app demonstrating the usage of Firebase Extensions, specifically the [Transcribe Speech to Text](https://extensions.dev/extensions/googlecloud/speech-to-text) by Google Cloud. The app supports Android, iOS, and web platforms.

Users can take or import photos from their devices and record a voice note. These are saved to Firebase Storage, and the Speech-to-Text extension transcribes the voice recordings and saves the transcriptions to Firestore. The app displays the transcriptions next to the corresponding images.

## Getting Started

To run this app locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

1. **Flutter SDK**: Ensure you have Flutter installed on your machine. You can follow the installation guide [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
2. **Firebase CLI**: Required to interact with Firebase services from the command line.

### Steps

1. **Create a Firebase Project**
   - Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Click on "Add Project" and follow the setup steps.

2. **Authenticate Firebase on Your Machine**
   - Open a terminal and run:
     ```bash
     curl -sL https://firebase.tools | bash
     firebase login
     ```

3. **Activate Flutterfire CLI**
   - Run the following command to activate the Flutterfire CLI:
     ```bash
     dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
     ```

4. **Configure Flutter App to Use Firebase**
   - Navigate to your Flutter project directory.
   - Run the Flutterfire CLI to configure your app:
     ```bash
     flutterfire configure
     ```
   - Follow the prompts to select the Firebase project you created and enable the platforms you are targeting (Android, iOS, and web).

5. **Enable Necessary Firebase Products**
   - In the Firebase Console, go to the **Authentication** section:
     - Enable Anonymous Authentication.
   - In the **Firestore Database** section:
     - Create a Firestore database and set the security rules according to your needs. Here's an example of basic rules:
       ```json
       service cloud.firestore {
         match /databases/{database}/documents {
           match /{document=**} {
             allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
           }
         }
       }
       ```
   - In the **Storage** section:
     - Set up Firebase Storage and configure its security rules. Example:
       ```json
       service firebase.storage {
         match /b/{bucket}/o {
           match /{allPaths=**} {
             allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
           }
         }
       }
       ```

6. **Install Firebase Extensions**
   - In the Firebase Console, navigate to the **Extensions** section.
   - Find and install the **Transcribe Speech to Text** extension by Google Cloud.
   - Follow the configuration steps, ensuring the extension is set to transcribe audio files uploaded to your specified Firebase Storage bucket and save the transcriptions to Firestore.

 Note: Extension is triggered when **any** new write in the storage happens. As I also store images, I decided to setup separate storage bucket for recordings. You can create new bucket in Firebase console and change
 ```recordingBucketName``` in ```main.dart```.

### Running the App

1. Clone the repository.
2. Get the dependencies:

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```
 3. Setup Firebase as mentioned in previous section.
 4. Run the app:

    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

## Firebase Products Used

-   **Firebase Authentication**: For user authentication (Anonymous Authentication).
-   **Cloud Firestore**: To store the transcriptions and keep track of content added by users.
-   **Firebase Storage**: To store the uploaded photos and voice recordings.
-   **Firebase Extensions**: Transcribe Speech to Text by Google Cloud to transcribe voice recordings.
